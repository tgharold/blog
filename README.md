# Tech Blog

This content used to live at [tgharold.blogspot.com](http://tgharold.blogspot.com/), but I've been looking for time to move to jekyll+git.  The old Blogger.com interface has been getting harder to deal with and I've lost more than a few draft posts. 

Redoing things in a git repo gives me more control, less dependency on a 3rd party (Jekyll files can be published anywhere), plus version control of the content.

## Skinny Bones Jekyll Starter

This blog is based on the [Minimal Mistakes Skinny Bones](https://github.com/mmistakes/skinny-bones-jekyll/) template.
It had to be adjusted slightly to account for GitHub pages putting the root of the GitHub repo at the "/blog" sub-directory.
